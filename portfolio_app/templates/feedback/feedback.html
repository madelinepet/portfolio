    "While only with us a short time, Madi helped facilitate several features and projects along with helping us grow as a team, and an organization."
</p>
<p>
    "your attitude and work style was a breath of fresh air in the infra team"
</p>
<p>
    "You've got a good head on your shoulders and an excellent work ethic, and a pleasant demeanor. Sad I won't get to work with you further, but also very excited for you, because I think you'll go far."
</p>

    "I wanted to say you have a lot of talent and a great attitude, both will take you far in your career. You will be missed at Slalom but I'm happy for you."

    "What I admire the most is how Madi handled the challenges along the way. She was not daunted by the challenge of refactoring her solution multiple times to resolve issues and optimize the speed. Multiple teammates happily helped along the way and the interactions were really natural and organic. This shows that Madi has the team and the solution in mind, without egos or criticism becoming a factor. I cannot overstate the value of this admirable personality trait. Not everyone has the ability for "the best idea wins" when it's not their own idea. The best leaders are coachable all the time."

    "When things got tough, she clearly showed how she owned her part of the project and put in the extra effort without anyone convincing or cajoling her to do so. This maintains a high bar on the team as well as builds stronger bonds and trust."

    "For context, the project timeline required an extension which was stressful for the client to secure. The fast paced and fluid scope previously described has only intensified, as business pressures mounted due to production issues and additional client stakeholders have joined the team in recent weeks. Madi is performing very well and doing everything I'd ask in her role. She is clearly contributing to the overall team progress, which is especially important as the team is small/lean. Her work is integral to the progress to the project and we've endearing coined what she's built as "the Madi process". Madi continues to learn quickly and work in spaces that she previously had not experienced yet, she is a diligent and active learner. I can tell that she is making good use of her time with the more senior developers, as her daily updates show a clear understanding of the problems at hand as well the thought process employed to tackle it. Her JIRA updates are fantastic, she summarizes her progress, where she has problems and what she plans to do next. [...] it's worthwhile to restate that I think Madi is a quick study, proactive and a valued contributor to the team."

    "Even though your role was a Data Engineer but you still try your best jumping in on task that's outside your comfort zone. You tried your best to finish it, and get help when needed. I think you really own your task well"
</p>
<p>
    "I have no doubt you are going to be a successful DE professional and future leader either at Slalom or beyond. I was talking with [redacted] the other day - and we both agreed that your contribution to PlutoTV made a huge impact on the team."
</p>

"You're doing great already, Madi, and you're highly regarded amongst the instructional team as one of 'those students' that's just going to be awesome regardless of what you do."
